    title: "Disabled People Can't Enjoy Life",
    shortDescription: "The harmful belief that disability prevents joy and fulfillment",
    longDescription: "This belief assumes that having a disability inherently prevents someone from experiencing joy, satisfaction, or a fulfilling life. It fails to recognize that people with disabilities live rich, complex lives with the same range of emotions, experiences, and potential for happiness as anyone else.",
    reality: "People with disabilities experience the full range of human emotions and can lead happy, fulfilling lives. Joy and quality of life are not determined by disability status but by many factors including community, purpose, and access to needed accommodations.",

    testimonial: 1,

    title: "Disabled Needs Are 'Special'",
    shortDescription: "The misconception that accessibility is an extra accommodation rather than a basic right",
    longDescription: "Labeling accessibility needs as 'special' suggests they are extra, unusual or burdensome accommodations rather than basic requirements for equal participation. This framing creates a hierarchical system where non-disabled needs are seen as standard while disabled needs are viewed as additional or exceptional.",
    reality: "Accessibility is a fundamental right, not a special privilege. Accommodations simply provide equitable access to the same experiences, services, and opportunities that are available to everyone else.",
    icon: "accommodation",
    color: "blue",
    testimonial: 2,
    action: "Replace terms like 'special needs' with 'accessibility requirements' or simply 'needs'."

    title: "Disability Is Only Physical",
    shortDescription: "The narrow view that only visible, physical conditions qualify as disabilities",
    longDescription: "This belief ignores the vast spectrum of disabilities including cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, and acquired conditions. It creates barriers for people with non-physical disabilities who may face disbelief or resistance when seeking accommodations.",
    reality: "Disability encompasses a wide spectrum of conditions including neurological, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, and chronic illness. Each type of disability comes with unique experiences and accessibility requirements.",
    icon: "diversity",
    color: "purple",
    testimonial: 3,
    action: "Educate yourself about the diverse spectrum of disabilities beyond physical conditions."

    title: "Disability Can Always Be Seen",
    shortDescription: "The false assumption that all disabilities are visible or apparent",
    longDescription: "Many disabilities are not immediately observable to others, including chronic pain, fatigue conditions, autoimmune disorders, hearing impairments, vision impairments, cognitive differences, mental health conditions, and many others. This belief leads to questioning the legitimacy of 'invisible' disabilities.",
    reality: "Many disabilities are not visibly apparent. People with non-visible disabilities often face additional challenges such as having their needs questioned or dismissed because they 'don't look disabled.'",
    icon: "visibility",
    color: "blue",
    testimonial: 4,
    action: "Never question someone's disability status based on appearance."

    title: "Disabled People Are Lazy",
    shortDescription: "The harmful stereotype equating disability accommodations with a lack of effort",
    longDescription: "This prejudice assumes that people with disabilities who cannot perform tasks in conventional ways or who require accommodations are simply not trying hard enough. It ignores the significant effort many disabled people exert to navigate inaccessible environments and systems daily.",
    reality: "People with disabilities often expend considerably more energy than non-disabled people to accomplish the same tasks in environments not designed for them. Requiring accommodations is not laziness—it's about creating equitable conditions.",
    icon: "effort",
    color: "blue",
    testimonial: 5,
    action: "Recognize that needing different tools or methods isn't a reflection of work ethic."

    title: "Disabled People Are A Burden",
    shortDescription: "The dehumanizing view that disability creates dependency or burden on others",
    longDescription: "This belief frames disability as a burden on families, communities, and society, suggesting that people with disabilities primarily take resources without contributing. It fails to recognize the reciprocal nature of all human relationships and the valuable contributions disabled people make.",
    reality: "People with disabilities contribute to society in countless ways including economically, culturally, and socially. Every person has value beyond their productivity or independence, and interdependence is a normal part of all human communities.",
    icon: "community",
    color: "purple",
    testimonial: 6,
    action: "Acknowledge the multifaceted contributions of disabled people to communities and society."

    title: "Non-Visible Disability Is Less Disabling",
    shortDescription: "The misconception that invisible disabilities have less impact on daily life",
    longDescription: "This belief minimizes the challenges faced by those with conditions that aren't immediately apparent, suggesting their experiences are less legitimate or impactful. Conditions like chronic pain, autoimmune diseases, mental health disabilities, and many others can be profoundly limiting despite not being visible.",
    reality: "Non-visible disabilities can be just as limiting as visible ones and often come with the additional burden of having to repeatedly prove or explain one's disability to others who question its legitimacy.",
    icon: "hidden",
    color: "blue",
    testimonial: 7,
    action: "Take non-visible disabilities seriously and respect accommodation needs without requiring proof."

    title: "Disabled People Aren't Capable",
    shortDescription: "The prejudiced belief that disability equates to universal incompetence",
    longDescription: "This harmful generalization assumes disabled people lack skills, talents, or abilities across all areas of life. It leads to low expectations, underestimation, and diminished opportunities for education, employment, and participation.",
    reality: "Disability affects specific functions or activities, not universal capability. People with disabilities have a wide range of skills, talents, and abilities like anyone else, and can excel in numerous fields with appropriate accessibility.",
    icon: "capability",
    color: "purple",
    testimonial: 8,
    action: "Focus on a person's abilities rather than assumptions about limitations."

  {
    id: 9,
    title: "Disability Defines A Person",
    shortDescription: "The reductive view that a person's disability is their primary defining characteristic",
    longDescription: "This belief reduces complex individuals to a single aspect of their lives—their disability. It overlooks the multifaceted nature of human identity, including personalities, interests, skills, relationships, and countless other attributes that comprise who someone is.",
    reality: "Disability is one aspect of a person's experience, not their defining characteristic. People with disabilities have multifaceted identities, interests, and attributes that extend far beyond their disability status.",
    icon: "identity",
    color: "purple",
    testimonial: 9,
    action: "See and relate to the whole person, not just their disability."

    title: "Disabled People Need Fixing",
    shortDescription: "The medical model view that positions disability as something to be 'cured' rather than accommodated",
    longDescription: "This medical model perspective treats disability as a defect or abnormality that should be eliminated or cured rather than as a natural aspect of human diversity. It puts emphasis on changing the individual rather than addressing societal barriers.",
    reality: "Many disabled people don't view their disabilities as something that needs to be 'fixed.' The social model of disability recognizes that it's often environmental and societal barriers that are disabling, not the condition itself.",
    icon: "medicalModel",
    color: "blue",
    testimonial: 10,
    action: "Focus on removing barriers rather than 'fixing' differences."

    title: "Disabled People Need Saving",
    shortDescription: "The patronizing belief that positions disabled people as helpless victims needing rescue",
    longDescription: "This savior narrative portrays disabled people as passive recipients of charity or heroic intervention, rather than as autonomous individuals. It reinforces power imbalances and often centers the experiences and virtues of 'helpers' rather than those being 'helped.'",
    reality: "People with disabilities don't need to be 'saved'—they need equal rights, opportunities, and access. The appropriate approach is solidarity and allyship in removing barriers, not pity or heroism.",
    icon: "autonomy",
    color: "purple",
    testimonial: 11,
    action: "Partner with rather than pitying people with disabilities."

    id: 12,
    title: "Disabled People Need To Try Harder",
    shortDescription: "The ableist belief that willpower can overcome systemic barriers",
    longDescription: "This belief suggests that disability-related challenges can be overcome simply through greater individual effort, perseverance, or the right attitude. It ignores systemic barriers and places unreasonable pressure on disabled individuals to compensate for inaccessible environments and attitudes.",
    reality: "No amount of individual effort can fully overcome systemic barriers and inaccessible design. The responsibility for creating accessibility should not fall solely on those with disabilities.",
    icon: "barriers",
    color: "blue",
    testimonial: 12,
    action: "Focus on removing barriers rather than expecting disabled people to overcome them through sheer effort."
