    text: "People assume my life must be tragic because I use a wheelchair. They're shocked when they learn I'm a software engineer, married with two kids, and go rock climbing on weekends. My disability is part of who I am, but it's not the most interesting thing about me, and it certainly doesn't prevent me from enjoying life."

    text: "When I request captioning for meetings, it's not a 'special' need—it's the equivalent of turning on the lights for people who can see. Without captions, I simply can't access the information. Equal access isn't special treatment; it's a basic right."

    name: "Sophia",
    text: "Because my ADHD and autism aren't visible like a wheelchair or white cane, I've had people tell me I'm 'making up excuses' when I ask for accommodations. Cognitive disabilities are just as real and can be just as disabling as physical ones, especially in environments that aren't designed with neurodiversity in mind."

    text: "I have Crohn's disease, and the number of times I've been confronted for using accessible bathrooms or parking spots is exhausting. Just because I'm not visibly disabled in your eyes doesn't mean I don't legitimately need these accommodations."

    name: "Elena",
    text: "As someone with chronic fatigue syndrome, I often hear that I just need to 'push through' or 'everyone gets tired.' People don't understand that I'm not experiencing normal fatigue—and that I typically expend three times the energy to do basic tasks that others take for granted."

    name: "Michael",
    text: "I've had people tell me to my face that people like me are 'draining the system.' What they don't see is that I've been employed since I was 16, volunteer weekly at a community garden, and mentor young adults with similar disabilities. We all need support sometimes—that's what community is about."

    name: "Zara",
    text: "My fibromyalgia means I live with pain and cognitive fog every day. Because I 'look fine,' people expect me to function just like everyone else. The reality is that some days getting out of bed is my biggest achievement. Invisible doesn't mean insignificant."

    name: "Daniel",
    text: "In my previous job, my manager was shocked when I consistently outperformed my colleagues despite my cerebral palsy. The sad part is that her surprise was considered a compliment. The bar is set so low for disabled people that basic competence is treated as exceptional."

    name: "Ava",
    text: "I'm a parent, a physicist, a terrible cook, a decent pianist, and yes, I happen to be blind. When people introduce me as 'their blind friend,' it's as if all those other aspects of my identity disappear behind what they see as my defining characteristic."

    name: "Kai",
    text: "I don't need to be 'fixed.' I need buildings with ramps, websites that work with screen readers, and people who don't assume that my way of experiencing the world is inherently broken. My disability is part of my identity—changing it would change who I am."

    name: "Nadia",
    text: "The worst part of having a disability isn't the disability itself—it's dealing with people who approach me with pity or inspiration narratives. I don't want to be your inspiration porn. I want equal rights, accessible spaces, and to be treated like a full human being."

    name: "Jackson",
    text: "No amount of 'trying harder' will make stairs accessible to my wheelchair. No amount of 'positive thinking' will make print documents readable for blind people. The problem isn't our effort level—it's environments designed without us in mind."
