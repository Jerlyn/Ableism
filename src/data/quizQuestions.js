    question: "Which of the following is an example of ableist language?",
    options: [
      "That was a blind spot in my thinking.",
      "I'm so inspired by how you navigate the world with your disability.",
      "Would you like me to describe this image to you?",
      "Let me know what accommodations would make this event accessible for you."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Saying 'I'm so inspired by how you navigate the world with your disability' is an example of inspiration porn, which objectifies disabled people for the emotional benefit of non-disabled people. It frames normal life activities as extraordinary when done by disabled people."

    question: "What is the social model of disability?",
    options: [
      "The view that disabilities should be treated and cured by medical professionals",
      "The understanding that disability is caused by the way society is organized, not by a person's condition",
      "The belief that disabilities are primarily social constructs with no physical reality",
      "The idea that disabled people should adapt to fit into existing social structures"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The social model of disability recognizes that people are disabled by barriers in society, not by their conditions or differences. It focuses on removing these barriers to create equality and offers an alternative to the medical model, which views disability as a deficit to be fixed."

    question: "What's the problem with saying someone is 'confined to a wheelchair'?",
    options: [
      "It's too formal and clinical",
      "It's factually incorrect - wheelchairs are liberating mobility tools, not confining devices",
      "It doesn't specify the type of wheelchair",
      "It's unnecessarily verbose"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Saying someone is 'confined to a wheelchair' frames mobility aids negatively. For wheelchair users, their chairs are liberating tools that enable movement and independence, not confining devices. More respectful language includes 'wheelchair user' or 'person who uses a wheelchair.'"

    question: "Which is an example of ableism in design?",
    options: [
      "Including alt text on all images on a website",
      "Providing multiple ways to access information (text, audio, video)",
      "Creating a building with only stairs at the entrance",
      "Using plain language in communication materials"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Creating a building with only stairs at the entrance is ableist design because it assumes all users can navigate stairs, effectively excluding wheelchair users and others with mobility disabilities. Accessible design would include ramps or elevators alongside or instead of stairs."

    question: "What does 'disability' mean according to the social model?",
    options: [
      "Having a medical condition that impairs normal function",
      "Being unable to participate in mainstream activities",
      "The disadvantage or restriction caused by a society that doesn't account for people with impairments",
      "Any physical or mental condition that requires treatment"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
